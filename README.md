This project analyzes the rise in global average land temperature from 1950 to the present using historical climate data. The dataset was taken from Kaggle and visualized using Python libraries.

## 📁 Files Included
- `GlobalTemperatures.csv` – Original dataset
- `climate_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with full analysis
- `temperature_trend.csv` – Filtered, cleaned temperature data
- `temperature_plot.png` – Final temperature trend graph

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 🐼
- Matplotlib 📈
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

## 📌 Objective
To understand how global temperatures have changed over time and demonstrate data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Python.
